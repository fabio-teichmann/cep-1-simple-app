# cep-1-simple-app
Cloud Engineering Project 1 - Simple web app using AWS architecture

## Goal of this project
- create simple architecture diagram leveraging AWS services
- setup 3 basic layers for a simple web app: (1) application layer, (2) networking layer, and (3) persistence layer
- learn how to setup and connect basic AWS services (compute + storage)
- learn about availability and scalability and how this can be achieved in AWS
- document steps and learnings along the way

## Intended steps (plan)
- research AWS components suitable for this project (S3, RDS, ...)
- learn about highly available and scalable applications in AWS
- draw an architecture diagram
- find a suitable simple app concept that facilitates CRUD operations with the persistence layer
- implement the achitecture in AWS (console)
- test the implementation
- document all relevant steps and learnings
